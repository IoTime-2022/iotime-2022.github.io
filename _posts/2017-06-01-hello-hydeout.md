### Call for Technical Papers

Original, unpublished contributions are solicited in time-critical applications for the Internet of Things. Time is a crucial and sensitive matter in most IoT-based systems and applications. Smart factories, mobile and collaborative robots, autonomous systems, and virtual/mixed reality are a few examples of the next wave of applications that rely on accurate time and bounded (low) latency computing and communications. **The IoTime Workshop looks for cutting-edge approaches in the IoT vertical - from sensors to applications - in which time plays a significant factor**. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

- Real test-beds, proof-of-concept, pilot site descriptions, and industry experience for Time-Critical IoT-based systems
- Time-sensitive networking (TSN), Wireless TSN, and ultra-low latency, high-reliability communications
- Digital Twins to support time-critical networking in Industrial IoT
- Time-Critical IoT Applications
- Machine learning solutions and approaches for time-critical IoT-based systems
- Orchestration and Placement of computing and networking resources in the IoT Computer Continuum (Edge/Cloud)
- Performance Evaluation of time-critical IoT systems
- Reference Architectures for Time-Critical Things
- Management and Monitoring for Time-Critical Applications in IoT
- Efficient computing approaches for time-critical systems to decrease latency and computer resource usage
- Caching policies, strategies, and architectures at the network edge for time-critical IoT systems
